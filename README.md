## Data Sources
The data used in this project can be accessed from the **Data.gov Real Estate Sales Dataset**:
- **Link**: [Real Estate Sales Data (2001-2018)](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/real-estate-sales-2001-2018)

An attached dataset was also used to illustrate trends from 2017â€“2023.

## Tools Used
The data analysis and visualization were done using **Microsoft Excel**, which can be downloaded [here](https://microsoft.com).

## Data Processing Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Initial Inspection**
   - Load the dataset into Excel and inspect the data for completeness.
   - Identify key columns: sale date, property type, sales price, location.

2. **Data Cleaning Steps**
   - **Change Date Format:** Convert all date fields to a standard format (e.g., `MM/DD/YYYY`) to enable consistent analysis over time.
   - **Remove Duplicates:** Identify and remove duplicate entries to avoid data redundancy.
   - **Handle Missing Values:** Inspect columns for missing values and decide on imputation or removal strategies where necessary.

3. **Data Analysis**
   - **Sales Trend Analysis (2017 - 2023):** Identify annual sales volume changes to understand macro trends.
   - **Property Type Breakdown:** Analyze sales by property type to see which types (e.g., single-family, condos) perform best.
   - **Top and Bottom Sales by Volume:** Determine top-performing and underperforming locations by total sales.
   - **Sales vs. Assessed Value:** Compare the sales amount with the assessed property value to identify any disparities.

4. **Findings and Insights**
   - **Total Sales:** The overall sales volume for the period analyzed is $508M.
   - **Sales Peak:** Notable sales increase in 2020, potentially influenced by economic conditions or market demand.
   - **Top Property Type:** Four-family residential properties have the highest sales volume, showing strong demand in this category.
   - **High Performing Locations:** Willington stands out as the highest sales volume location, with $319M.
   - **Seasonality:** July consistently shows high sales, suggesting a seasonal pattern in real estate transactions.

## Recommendations
- **Focus on Four-Family Properties:** Given their strong sales performance, these properties represent a high-demand category worth further investment.
- **Capitalize on Summer Sales Peaks:** Market heavily during peak months to maximize sales.
- **Assess Single-Family Sales:** Further investigation is recommended to understand the factors behind single-family property sales trends.

## Limitations
- **Data Scope:** This analysis focuses only on 2017â€“2023. Trends prior to 2017 are not accounted for, which may limit long-term trend insights.
- **Data Quality:** Any inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the original dataset may impact analysis outcomes.
  
## Conclusion
This dashboard provides a user-friendly view of real estate sales trends, helping users make data-driven decisions based on market insights. Future updates could include interactive features for more dynamic filtering and real-time data integration.
